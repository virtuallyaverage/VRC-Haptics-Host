# VRC-Haptics-Host
A highly integrated based OSC haptics sever.

# [Original Project](https://github.com/CaiVR/CaiVR-Custom-Haptic-Vest-V1)
## Why?
Credit for hardware, firmware, and software development goes to [CaiVR](https://www.youtube.com/@Cai_VR). This is based off of his haptic suit initial project: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpQyehRNkGo), [Github](https://github.com/CaiVR/CaiVR-Custom-Haptic-Vest-V1)

I made a vest following CaiVR's original tutorial loosely and have made some changes/improvements to both the server and hardware that have been useful in-game and would like to share them. CaiVR does not wish to further complicate the original project since he is working on something else. [[source]()] So I am going to document/publish my modifications here. **CONTRIBUTIONS ARE WELCOMED**

Please use the Issues tab for any issues with the software. 
Feel free to say hi, although I probably won't be able to respond quickly.

# Design Principles
Contribution is more than appreciated, but please keep it close/aligned with the projects over all goals:
 - Robust 
    - not many "hacky" work arounds
    - feel free to open a branch or your own fork if you would like to work in collaboration before merging to main
 - Simple To set up 
    - users shouldn't have to spend half an hour downloading python dependencies, something similar to AUTOMATIC's Stable Diffusion is the goal. 
 - Follow common Python syntax, such as snake case variables (variable_name)
 - **Readable Code** 
    - I would prefer having slightly less performant code if it is easily understandable. 
    - Please avoid ambigous variable naming (temp, i, j, etc.)

If the project takes off than rules and goals can change as needed. These are just general guidelines to start off. 

## Future Goals
 - Improved VRC Integration
 - Live Configuration
 - Better Error handling
 - Working UI
 - Automatic Unity Installer
